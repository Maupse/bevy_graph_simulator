# Bevy Graph Simulator
An attempt on a graph builder with simulation of alogrithms and data structures.
The idea is that you place nodes by pressing your mouse button (or touching the screen on phone). 
- You can connect them via edges that you place by pressing two nodes (not implemented)
- You choose an algorithm and pick a start (and end) node to run with (not implemeted)

This project is a work in progress and will probably advance slowly over time.
